Errors are now explained, and a crash no longer freezes the game.

- **Core:** an exception in `update` or `render` used to kill the requestAnimationFrame loop while the game still reported itself as running, so `start()` couldn't recover it. Now the loop stops cleanly and records `game.lastError` (phase, scene and tick). It emits the new `hooks.error` and rethrows the error so the console still shows it. `start()` resumes.
- **Dev tools:** each error is labelled with whose problem it is: your code, a call debuff rejected, a debuff bug (with a prefilled report link) or something outside the game. It shows the source-mapped line, which opens in your editor, plus a plain-words hint. Repeats are counted. `errors()` and MCP `game_errors` return the same structure.
