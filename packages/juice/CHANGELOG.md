### Patch Changes

- 5504289: - **juice:** `squash()` only replaces scale tweens, so a move or fade already running on the same object keeps going (it used to stop every tween on its target). `tweens.kill(target, props?)` can stop just some properties, and `tweens.has(target, prop?)` says whether something is still animating.
  - **Scenarios and fuzz:** set the browser viewport with `scenarios: { viewport: [360, 640] }` in `debuff.config.ts`, or `"viewport"` in a scenario file, so portrait games are tested at their own shape instead of shrunk into 960×540.

### Minor Changes

- f50defb: Batched WebGL2 renderer behind a new `draw` API (ADR 0007).
  
  - New: `game.draw` with `sprite`, `rect`, `circle`, `line`, `text`, a transform stack, `withCamera`, `blend`, `alpha` and `raw`. It uses WebGL2 instanced, multi-texture batching with an automatic Canvas 2D fallback (`renderer: "auto" | "webgl2" | "2d"`), and sustains about 200k sprites at 60 fps on the renderer benchmark.
  - **Breaking:** `Scene.render(ctx)` becomes `Scene.render(draw)`, and render hooks receive `draw`. `game.ctx` is removed. `camera.apply(ctx)` is replaced by `draw.withCamera(camera, fn)` (`camera.view()` returns the matrix). `Sprite.draw`, `Particles.draw` and `Trail.draw` take `draw`.
  - New: `game.redraw()`, `renderer` in the dev state, and `@debuffjp/cli/client` types.
